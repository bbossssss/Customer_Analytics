# Customer Scoring

Customer scoring is a technique used by businesses to evaluate and rank their customers based on predefined criteria. It involves assigning a numerical score to each customer, typically on a scale, to quantify their potential value, engagement level, or likelihood to take specific actions. The scores are calculated by considering various attributes, behaviors, and interactions that customers exhibit.
