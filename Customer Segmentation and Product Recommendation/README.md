# Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation

This project focuses on customer segmentation and product recommendation using transaction data spanning three years. It involves the identification of distinct customer groups, the creation of a Sankey diagram to visualize customer payment behavior, and the use of the Apriori algorithm for product recommendations.

## Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical strategy to understand and target different customer groups effectively. In this project, we aim to segment customers into four distinct groups:

1. **Freeloaders**: Customers who have never made a purchase.
2. **Dormants**: Customers who made purchases in the past but have not done so recently.
3. **New Payers**: Customers who have recently made their first purchase.
4. **Loyalists**: Customers who have consistently made purchases over the years.

Additionally, we will utilize the Apriori algorithm to provide product recommendations to customers based on their transaction history.
